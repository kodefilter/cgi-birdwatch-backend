## Reflection

Although it looked simple application at first glance only the basic functionalities of the project were simple. Assignment mentioned
many additional features that were really interesting but needed additional skills and time. Personally, I was comfortable with the requirements
and have implemented the basic ones but it took it a lot of time to build the front end especially populating the data on the table.

Overall it was a fun experience, I will try to add all the listed features to this application in future
